# CIS-5120-Assignment-1

This repository contains a static, phone-sized HTML/CSS prototype of an improved :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} course page with a **Register Now** button.  
It replicates the design from my high-fidelity prototype for my UI design assignment.

## How to Run
1. Download this repository as a ZIP or clone it.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

## Notes
- This is a **static** prototype. The buttons do not perform actions.
- Designed to match mobile (390Ã—844) screen dimensions.

## Attributions
- Code scaffold and styling were generated with assistance from ChatGPT (GPT-5), and then reviewed and customized by me.
- No external libraries or frameworks were used.
